City-Future_CSharp_Game
=======================

C# 3D City Building Game using Unity Engine

The goal is to have a game much deeper than the current city building games currently available.

Chain of production
----------------
With features such as "Chain of production", every item a commercial building sells will first need to pass through various industrial buildings in order for it acquire its final form. Commercial buildings can also export these items for an increase revenue. 

An item to be made will undergo processes such as: gathering the raw material, production of the item and packaging. After all that it will be shipped to local commercial buildings or exported.

Shops will need to mantain inventory and basic office supplies in order to function.

All these interactions will be handled by the AI, however, it's your job to keep the economy growing and create custom incentives for industry, commercial and residential to prosper.

Total control over the economy with custom incentives
----------------
It is nothing but a tool that will let you have control over
the inner variables that compose the economy. Want to increase tax on imports of electronics? want to cut the taxes on
construction supplies for small businesses? Want to set a fixed price for gas? These are a few examples of how powerful this tool
will be, allowing total control over the economy of the game.


Currently I am building the framework that will backup all the systems of the game.

<b>Phase 1:</b> Creating Buildings, Maps and Agents structure. -Current.  
<b>Phase 2:</b> Implementing basic functions such as when buildings upgrade, and the initial type & density of the building when
 instantiated based on the environment.  
<b>phase 3:</b> implementing basic agents functions such as when they are happy, or their needs.  
<b>Phase 4:</b> Implementing functions of interaction between buildings, creating chain of supply/demand of buildings.  
<b>phase 5:</b> ...
